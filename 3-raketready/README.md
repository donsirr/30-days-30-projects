# Raket-Ready

Raket-Ready is a specialized compliance utility designed for Filipino freelancers and independent professionals. It simplifies the complexities of the Philippine tax system under the Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT) Act, providing a clear and actionable path to legitimacy.

## Project Overview

The application serves as a dedicated digital consultant, helping users determine their optimal tax strategy and guiding them through the registration process with government bureaus. By inputting basic professional details, users receive instant, calculated insights without the need for manual computation or legal guesswork.

## Key Capabilities

### Intelligent Tax Calculation
The system analyzes gross annual income and profession type to project estimated tax dues. It automatically compares the 8% Flat Income Tax Rate against the Graduated Income Tax Schedule, recommending the most cost-effective regime for the user.

### Compliance Roadmap
Raket-Ready generates a tailored, step-by-step guide for business registration. This includes specific directives for dealing with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Local Government Units (LGU), and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). The roadmap adapts to specific user profiles, such as licensed professionals versus sole proprietors using a trade name.

### EOPT Act Integration
The platform is built with the latest regulations in mind, specifically the Republic Act No. 11976. It reflects critical beneficial updates, such as the abolition of the Annual Registration Fee (Form 0605), ensuring users are not paying for obsolete requirements.

### Digital Toolkit
Beyond calculation, the application provides a suite of practical tools:
- **Tax Savings Analysis**: Highlights potential savings between different tax regimes.
- **Dynamic Document Checklist**: A tracked inventory of required documents for submission.
- **PDF Generation**: Instantly compiles a professional "Compliance Guide" document that users can download and print for reference during their physical registration process.
